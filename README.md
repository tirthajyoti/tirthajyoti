### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! This is Tirtha. I am an adventurer.

### Work
I am a Data Science Engineering Manager at [Adapdix Corp,](https://www.adapdix.com/) putting the power of AI/ML on the Edge for [Industry 4.0](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/09/02/what-is-industry-4-0-heres-a-super-easy-explanation-for-anyone/?sh=587ea6ab9788) and next-generation [Smart Factory](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/industry-4-0/smart-factory-connected-manufacturing.html).

### Currently...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: lectures/workshops, courses, and spreading knowledge on machine learning/statistical modeling.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: _ML flow management tools, and how AI/ML applies to Industrial IoT_.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: **Data science/ML books**. Probably will use [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and [Leanpub platform](https://leanpub.com/)

### Books, lectures, articles
I publish highly-cited articles regularly on data science and machine learning topics, on leading platforms such [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/@tirthajyoti), [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/author/tirthajyoti-sarkar), and [Analytics Vidya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/why-a-business-analytics-problem-demands-all-of-your-expertise-at-once-1290170808c4). 

I also teach [IEEE/ACM workshops on data science/ machine learning](https://valleyml.thinkific.com/bundles/machine-learning-and-deep-learning-boot-camp).

My first data science related book [Data wrangling with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Creating-actionable-ebook/dp/B07JF26NGJ) was published on February, 2019. In future, I wish to self-publish a second book about Hands-on mathematics/statistics for data scientists.

### Open-source

### Contribution to the technical community
I am serving on the Technical Content Committee for the [Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) West, 2020](https://odsc.com/california/).

In 2015, I was elevated to the grade of **[Senior Member of IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/membership/senior/senior-requirements.html)** for my contributions towards power electronics. I have **authored/co-authored more than 25 peer-reviewed Transaction and Conference papers, 2 monographs/book chapters, and 4 U.S. Patents**. Here is my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PUAA0uQAAAAJ&hl=en).

I also serve on the technical program committee as Track/Topic chair in numerous IEEE conferences. I am the co-chair of the [Semiconductor Committee of Power Supply Manufacturers' Association (PSMA)](https://www.psma.com/meetings/semiconductor-committee-0).
