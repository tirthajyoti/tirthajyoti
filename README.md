### Work
I am working as **VP, AI/ML**, at [Rhombus Power Inc.](https://rhombuspower.com/), where I am building exciting and critically important solutions with AI, Data, and Math. 

Before this, I was a **Data Science and Solutions Engineering Manager** at [Adapdix Corp,](https://www.adapdix.com/) putting the power of AI/ML on the Edge for [Industry 4.0](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/09/02/what-is-industry-4-0-heres-a-super-easy-explanation-for-anyone/?sh=587ea6ab9788) and next-generation [Smart Factory](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/industry-4-0/smart-factory-connected-manufacturing.html).

Even before that, I was a **Sr. Principal Engineer** developing power semiconductor technologies and applying AI/ML for semiconductor product/tech deveklopment at [ON Semiconductor, also known as onsemi](https://www.onsemi.com/).

At its core, **I translate customer business problems into data-driven problems and help build solutions**.

### Currently...

- ðŸ”­ Writing a book with [Apress/Springer](https://www.apress.com/us) on the topic of ***"Productive and Efficient Data Science"***. You can [pre-order the book here](https://www.amazon.com/Productive-Efficient-Data-Science-Python/dp/1484281209/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: lectures/workshops, courses, and spreading knowledge on machine learning/statistical modeling. In particular, I serving as the **Track Chair of "AI Optimization" track** for the **[ValleyML AI Expo 2021](https://www.valleyml.ai/)**. Also, I am developing course content for the **[ValleyML Fellowship program](https://www.valleyml.ai/fellowship)**.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: _ML flow management tools_, _Ray serve and distributed computing_, and how AI/ML applies to the various aspects of the Industrial IoT sector.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: **Data science/ML books**. Probably will use [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and [Leanpub platform](https://leanpub.com/)

### Books, lectures, articles
I publish highly-cited articles regularly on data science and machine learning topics, on leading platforms such [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/@tirthajyoti), [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/author/tirthajyoti-sarkar), and [Analytics Vidya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/why-a-business-analytics-problem-demands-all-of-your-expertise-at-once-1290170808c4). 

I also teach [IEEE/ACM workshops on data science/ machine learning](https://valleyml.thinkific.com/bundles/machine-learning-and-deep-learning-boot-camp).

My first data science related book [Data wrangling with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Creating-actionable-ebook/dp/B07JF26NGJ) was published on February, 2019. In future, I wish to self-publish a second book about Hands-on mathematics/statistics for data scientists.
